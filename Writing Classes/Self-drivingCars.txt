The pros of self-driving cars are that they can avoid crashes better than humans
can and make better decisions.

Self driving cars face ethical challenges with no-win situations because different
cultures have different values.

A way we can prevent ethical concerns with self-driving cars is by having the
driver decide which outcome it would prefer in the situation and place the burden
on the driver.
